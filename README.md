# dokuwiki-plugin-foldablelist
plugin that makes an unordered list invisible after n items

## how to use?
simply wrap an unordered list into the tags

`<foldablelist>  
  my list 
</foldablelist>`

this list can be generated via markup or dokuwiki plugins like the tag-plugin.

## why use?
people like to put "important stuff" on startpage and the department i work in is not different.
Things considered "important" get written on startpage, usually as lists (upcoming meetings, changes in workflow, new orders by the boss ...)
and each list naturally grows as new items are added on top but older items remain important enough to keep them..

Our startpage has grown to a length of 4 screen-pages by now because of that, so sooner
or later my boss asked me to reduce the visible number of items on those lists to
a certain minimum.    

This plugin adresses the issue in a quick and cosmetic way: 
all information is still available, but (hopefully) less important stuff gets hidden by default.
